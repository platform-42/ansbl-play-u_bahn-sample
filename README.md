# 🚉 Neo4j Railway Graph Loader (Ansible Playbook)

This Ansible playbook automates the process of loading **stations** (nodes) and **tracks** (relationships) into a **Neo4j** graph database.  
It is designed to work with the custom Neo4j Ansible collection:
- `neo4j.vertex`
- `neo4j.edge`
- `neo4j.query_read`
- `neo4j.graph_reset`
- `neo4j.label`
- `neo4j.constraint`

---

## 🧩 Overview

The playbook reads YAML or JSON definitions of railway infrastructure (stations and tracks) and applies them declaratively to a Neo4j database.

**Example use case:**
- Import a set of train stations and the tracks connecting them.
- Keep the graph model consistent with a source of truth file.
- Easily reapply or modify data using idempotent Ansible runs.
